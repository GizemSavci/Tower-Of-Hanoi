# Tower of Hanoi Game

Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle game that challenges players to move a tower of disks from one peg to another while following specific rules. The objective is to move all the disks from the source peg to the target peg, using an intermediate peg, such that no larger disk is placed on top of a smaller one.
